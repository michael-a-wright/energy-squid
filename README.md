This is a personal repository containing my utility code files and template for projects. I am attempting to build a set of powerful generic functions that help my workflow. The iPython files each correspond to a step of some kind of project. The examples folder contains examples of the types of graphs generated by the utility files.

sd-eda: Exploratory Data Analysis. Contains two kinds of charts I like to use when first picking apart a new classification problem.

template.zip: File structure I like using for my projects. Prototypes usually contains test cases for important iterative code - for example, scraping a single web page in order to prepare to scrape many, many web pages like it.
